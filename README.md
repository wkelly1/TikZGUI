# TikZGUI

## Inspiration
Frustration with LaTeX ðŸ˜¡

## What it does
Provides a clean GUI to create graphics then generates TikZ code to display the graphic in a LaTeX document ðŸ™Œâœ¨

## How we built it
We built a JavaFX application for the user to see and manipulate the graphics, a back end to handle the representation and an shape interpreter to translate shape objects into TikZ code

## Challenges we ran into
JavaFX, Maven and Linux

## Accomplishments weâ€™re proud of
Making a responsive JavaFX app! Modular and expandable code, functional style java

## What we learned
Donâ€™t use JavaFX?
